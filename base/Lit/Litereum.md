Litereum: the simplest decentralized computer
=============================================

In 2013, the first decentralized computer, Ethereum, was proposed, extending
Bitcoin with a stateful scripting language that allowed arbitrary transactions
to be settled without third parties. Due to its experimental nature, Ethereum
grew incresingly complex, leading to security issues and an unbalance of power
between developers and users. Litereum is a massive simplification and
polishment of the concept, which trades scalability and cutting-edge features
for simplicity and code quality. It is highly inspired by type theory, and
designed to never require updates, eliminating the developer class, and
resulting in a minimal, secure and politically neutral decentralized computer.

Design
------

Litereum's design is a combination of 3 components:

1. LitSign: a minimal, hash-based signature scheme that can't be broken by quantum
   computers. It is an adaptation of WOTS signatures.

2. LitCons: a minimal, proof-of-work consensus algorithm for peer-to-peer
   transactions. It is a simplification of Nakamoto Consensus.

3. LitCore: a minimal, statically-typed language prone to formal
   verification. It is a stateful calculus based on datatypes and recursion.

Litereum doesn't have a native currency. Instead, it is a truly pure and neutral
decentralized computer.

Roadmap
-------

2021. Publish the white-paper and reference implementations.

That's all: Litereum is final and won't require updates.
