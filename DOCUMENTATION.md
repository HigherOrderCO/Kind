Motivation
==========

> Knowing mathematics and programming might one day be one... fills you with determination.

Formality exists to fill a hole in the current market: there aren't many
languages featuring *theorem proving* that are simple, user-friendly and
efficient. To accomplish that goal, we rely on several design philosophies:

An accessible syntax
--------------------

Proof languages often have complex syntaxes that make an
already difficult subject even more inaccessible. Coq, for
example, uses 3 different languages with completely
different rules and tons of reserved words and special
tokens.  Agda is clean and beautiful, but relies heavily on
unicode and agda-mode, making it essentially unusable
outside of EMACs, which is arguably a ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù editor.
Formality aims to keep a simple, familiar syntax that is
much closer to common languages like Python and JavaScript.
A regular TypeScript developer should, for example, be able
to read our [natural number](https://github.com/moonad/Base.fm/blob/master/Nat.fm)
formalization without prior knowledge.

Fast and portable "by design"
-----------------------------

Some languages are inherently slow, by design. JavaScript, for example, is
slower than C: all things equal, its mandatory garbage collector will be an
unavoidable disadvantage. Formality is meant to be as fast as theoretically
possible. For example, it has affine lambdas, allowing it to be
run without garbage-collection. It has a strongly confluent interaction-net
runtime, allowing it to be evaluated in massively parallel architectures. It
doesn‚Äôt require De Bruijn bookkeeping, making it the fastest ‚Äúclosure chunker‚Äù
around. It is lazy, it has a clear cost model for blockchains, it has a small
([600 LOC](https://github.com/moonad/Formality/blob/master/src/fm-net.ts))
runtime that can easily be ported to multiple platforms. Right now, Formality‚Äôs
compiler isn‚Äôt as mature as the ones found in decades-old languages, but it has
lots of room for improvement.

An elegant underlying Type Theory
---------------------------------

Formality's unique approach to termination is conjectured to
allow it to have elegant, powerful type-level features that
would be otherwise impossible without causing logical
inconsistencies. For example, instead of a complex system of
built-in datatypes, we rely on [Self Types](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Self-Types-for-Dependently-Typed-Lambda-Encodings-Fu-Stump/652f673e13b889e0fd7adbd480c2fdf290621f66),
which allows us to implement inductive families with native
lambdas. That makes the core theory an order of magnitude
simpler, allowing for a short standard and encouraging
independent implementations.

An optimal high-order evaluator
-------------------------------

Formality's substitution algorithm is **asymptotically faster** than Haskell's,
Clojure's, JavaScript's and other closure implementations. This makes it
extremely fast at evaluating high-order programs, combining a Haskell-like
high-level feel with a Rust-like low-level performance curve. For example,
Haskell's stream fusion, a hard-coded, important optimization, happens
naturally, [at runtime](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/solving-the-mystery-behind-abstract-algorithms-magical-optimizations-144225164b07),
on Formality. This also allows us to explore new ways to develop algorithms,
such as this "impossibly efficient" [exp-mod
implementation](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/calling-a-function-a-googol-times-53933c072e3a).
Who knows if this may lead to new breakthroughs in complexity theory?

Installation
============

Right now, Formality can only be installed through npm. Install npm following
[this guide](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Then, go to the command-line and
type:

```
$ npm i -g formality-lang
```

Using [`node2nix`](https://github.com/svanderburg/node2nix#installation), we
can also install Formality using the Nix package manager:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:moonad/Formality.git
$ cd Formality
$ nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/nixpkgs-unstable unstable
$ nix-env -f '<unstable>' -iA nodePackages.node2nix
$ node2nix -d -i package.json --nodejs-12
$ nix-env -i -f override.nix
```

In order to test if it worked, type `fm` on the terminal. If you see Formality's
command-line options, then it has been successfully installed in your system. If
you have any problem during this process, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/moonad/Formality/issues).


Introduction
============

Evaluation
----------

This is the "Hello, World!" in Formality:

```haskell
-- HelloWorld.fm
import Base#

main : String
  "Hello, world!"
```

A Formality file is just a list of imports followed by a
series of top-level definitions. Here, we have one top-level
definition, `main`, with type `String`, and body `"Hello,
world"`. Save this file as `HelloWorld.fm`.  To run it, type

```haskell
$ fm -d HelloWorld/main
"Hello, world!"
```

This will evaluate `main` using an interpreter in debug mode
and output `"Hello, world!"`. If your term is elementary, try:

```haskell
$ fm -o HelloWorld/main
"Hello, world!"
{"loops":1953,"rewrites":146,"max_len":161}
```

It evaluates your term using [interaction
combinators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.0380.pdf), making it
suitable for innovative optimizations such as runtime
fusion, as explained on [this
post](https://medium.com/@maiavictor/solving-the-mystery-behind-abstract-algorithms-magical-optimizations-144225164b07),
as well as not needing a garbage collector, being highly
parallelizable, and having great computational
characteristics in general. Elementary terms are those that
only use lambda-bound variables more than once in a
controlled manner. The type-checker will inform you if
that's the case by appending a `‚Ñ∞` to its type. Right now,
it might not always be able to tell; the elementarity
checker is still ongoing work.

If your terms is affine, i.e., doesn't use lambda-bound
variables more than once at all, you can use the fast
evaluator with `-f`. It is like the optimal evaluator, but
much faster in programs that don't use a lot of sharing
(variable duplication). The type-checker will inform you if
that's the case by appending a `ùíú` to its type. The fast
evaluator doesn't support numbers (thus strings) currently.

Type-Checking
-------------

To type-check a term, type:

```shell
$ fm -t HelloWorld
String ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

This will check if the program's type is correct. If the type is incorrect, it
will print an error message instead.

For example, if you change `"Hello, world!"` to `true`, you
get:

```shell
[ERROR]
Type mismatch.
- Found type... Bool
- Instead of... String
- When checking true
- On line 4, col 6, file HelloWorld.fm:
   1| import Base#
   2|
   3| main : String
   4|   true
   5|
```

Because `true` is a `Bool`, but the `main` expression expects
a `String`.

Type-checking not only gives you a guarantee that your
program won't have runtime errors, but, since Formality has
an expressive type-system, it can also give you arbitrarily
complex statical assurances about your program's behavior.
In fact, Formality can be used to write and prove
mathematical theorems through its type system. For example,
this proves `2 == 2`:

```haskell
-- TwoIsTwo.fm
import Base#

main : 2 == 2
  equal(__)
```

Save this file as `TwoIsTwo.fm` and run:

```haskell
$ fm -t TwoIsTwo/main
Equal(Number, 2, 2) ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

The fact this program type-checks means Formality
mechanically checked a mathematical proof that 2 is equal to
2. Note that proofs can only be trusted if they are
terminating; otherwise, one could derive logical paradoxes.
The type-checker will let you know if that is the case by
appending a `‚Ñã` to its type, but it might not be always able
to tell due to the halting problem. Of course, proving that
`2 == 2` is not interesting, but one could prove more
important theorems such as `CantBeDrained(contract) ‚úî`. How
proofs can be used to make your programs safer will be
explored later.

Compilation
-----------

Since Formality's core language is extremelly simple - it is
just the Œª-calculus with numbers - it is very easy to
compile it to multiple targets. For example, let's compile
the following library to JavaScript:

```haskell
twice(n: Number)
  n * 2

vector_size(x: Number, y: Number) : Number
  ((x ** 2) + (y ** 2)) ** 0.5

sum(n : Number) : Number
  if n === 0 then
    0
  else
    n + sum(n - 1)
```

Save it as `lib.fm` and type:

```
fm -J lib/@
```

This will output:

```javascript
(function(){
  var _lib$twice = (_0=>(_0*2));
  var _lib$vector_size = (_0=>(_1=>(((_0**2)+(_1**2))**0.5)));
  var _lib$sum = (_0=>((_0===0? 1 : 0)?0:(_0+_lib$sum((_0-1)))));
  return {
    'twice':_lib$twice,
    'vector_size':_lib$vector_size,
    'sum':_lib$sum
  };
})()
```

Export that function as a JS module, `lib.js`, and use it as:

```javascript
const {twice, vector_size, sum} = require("./lib.js");

console.log("Double of 2:", twice(2));
console.log("Length of the [3,4] vector:", vector_size(3)(4));
console.log("Summation from 0 til 10 is:", sum(10));
```

Note that the default compiler uses native functions. The
advantage is that this makes interop very easy. The
disadvantage is that it relies on the performance of those
functions. Alternatively, you could load the Formality
program in an interaction net (or other) runtime inside the
target language. In a future, we'll have compilers to
several common languages such as Python, Ruby, Lua, Go. It
is very easy to compile Formality to a new target, specially
if it has high-order functions. 

### Ethereum

You can also compile a Formality program to Ethereum. Save
the following program as `example.fm`:

```haskell
import Base#

main
  double(7n)
```

And type:

```
fm -E example/main
```

This will output:

```

```

Which is an EVM bytecode that evaluates the `main` function.
When that program is done running, it leaves, on Ethereum's
memory, a buffer representing the normal form of the input
program. Since the EVM is a very resource-scarce
environment, this compiler uses our fastest runtime, which
only accepts affine terms (`ùíú`). Each function application
(beta-reduction) uses roughly 200 gas, which is surprisingly
low: only about 25x more than a native MULMOD operation! 

Right now, this compiler only performs the computations on
the EVM, it doesn't do any contract interaction. It also
doesn't feature Number, since Ethereum doesn't have doubles.
In a future, contract interaction will be added to this
compiler, and 64-bit uints will be added to the language,
allowing us to use Ethereum's native 256-bit uint.

and browse [this repository](https://github.com/moonad/formality-evm-example).

Effects
-------

So far, we only explained how to evaluate pure terms. But
how do we run actual programs that interact with the real
world? One way is to use Formality to export a module in a
common programming language, such as JavaScript, and then
use that language as a bridge to the real world. This
approach is being used to develop
[TaelinArena](https://github.com/moonad/TaelinArena), an
online game. Another way is to model your effects using a
datatype (this will be explained later) and then write an
interpreter for it. This is what Haskell does by default
with its `IO` type. Formality's base-lib features a similar
one. For example:

```haskell
import Base#

main : IO(Unit)
  print("Hello, world!")
```

Save the program above as `main.fm`. If you run it with `fm
-d main/main`, you'll see:

```
(exec, pure) => exec((putstr, getstr) => putstr("Hello, world!"), (x, exec, pure) => pure((unit) => unit))
```

Which isn't what you expected. That's because `-d` evaluates
a pure program. In this case, this pure program is a
"recipe" for the evaluation of an effectful one. To run
it with the effects, type `fm -r main/main` instead. This
will output:

```
Hello, world!
```

The fun thing about IO is that it allows you to interact
with the external world and get user inputs. For example,
this program:

```haskell
import Base#

main : IO(Unit)
  do {
    var name = question("What is your name?")
    print(concat(_ "Hello, ", name))
  }
```

Asks the user's name and then greets him. This program:

```javascript
import Base#

main : IO(Unit)
  for i = 0~100
    print(number_to_string(10, i))
```

Prints all numbers from `0` til `99`. And this program:

```haskell
import Base#

program(count : Number) : IO(Unit)
  do {
    -- Prints instructions
    print("Commands:")
    print("- [i] increments by 1")
    print("- [d] decreases by 1")
    print("- [r] resets")
    print("- (other) quits")
    print("")
    print(concat(_ "Count: ", number_to_string(10, count)))
    print("")

    -- Gets the user command
    var cmd = question("Enter your command:")
    let key = head(_ 0, cmd)

    -- Increases
    if key === 'i' then
      program(count + 1)

    -- Decreases
    else if key === 'd' then
      program(count - 1)

    -- Reset
    else if key === 'r' then
      program(0)

    -- Quits
    else do {
      print("Bye!")
      return unit
    }
  }

main : IO(Unit)
  program(0)
```

Allows the user to interactively increment and decrement a
counter.

Like on Haskell, effects are performed monadically, i.e.,
they're "pure programs that describe impure programs". The
`do{}`, `for` and `return` used on those examples are
syntax-sugars that become calls to functions on the
[IO.fm](https://github.com/moonad/Base.fm/blob/master/IO.fm)
file of Formality's base library. Explaining how this works
in more details is out of the scope of this guide for now,
but a tutorial might be added in a future.

Primitives
==========

Type
----

A type is some collection of values. The `:` symbol means "has type/is of type":

```javascript
"cat" : String
true : Bool
1n : Nat
7 : Number
```

This means `"cat"` is a `String`, `true` is a `Bool` (boolean), `1n` is a
`Nat` (natural number) and `7` is a `Number` (native double).

Lambda
------

| syntax                     | description                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `(x : A, y : B, ...) -> D` | Function type from `x : A`, `y : B` to `D`      |
| `(x, y, ...) => body `     | Lambda with binding `x`, `y` over `body`        |
| `f(x, y, ...)`             | Applies the function `f` to  arguments `x`, `y` |

Excluding numbers, lambdas (also called function) are the
only computational primitive of Formality. Everything, from
booleans, to list, to complex algorithms, data structures,
and mathematical proofs are compiled to lambdas.

As in other functional languages, lambdas are curried. `(x, y, z, ...) => body`
is the same as `(x) => (y) => (z) => ...  body`, and `f(x, y, z)` is the same as
`f(x)(y)(z)...`.

The type of a function is written as `A -> B -> C -> D`, like in Haskell, but it
can also be written with names, as `(x : A, y : B, z : C ...) -> D`.

You can define a top-level function as follows:

```haskell
-- SameWorld.fm
import Base#

same : String -> String
  (x) => x

main : String
  same("Hello, world!")
```

Try type-checking and running:

```haskell
$ fm -t SameWorld
String ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã

$ fm -t SameWorld/same
(_ : String) -> String ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã

$ fm -d SameWorld
"Hello, World"
```

You can also include the variable names before the `:`:

```haskell
-- SameWorld2.fm
import Base#

same(x : String) : String
  x

main : String
  same("Hello, world!")
```

Functions can be inlined:

```haskell
-- SameWorld3.fm
import Base#

same(x : String) : String
  x

callF(f : String -> String, x : String) : String
  f(x)

main : String
  callF((x) => same(x), "Hello, world!")
```

If Formality can't infer the type of `x`, you can add it after the name:

```haskell
-- AnnotatedLambdaWorld.fm
import Base#

main : String
  ((x : String) => x)("Hello, world!")
```

Or after the function, with an explicit annotation (`::`):

```haskell
-- ExplicitAnnotationWorld.fm
import Base#

main : String
  (((x) => x) :: String -> String)("Hello, world!")
```

Types are optional. This won't type-check, but you can still run it:

```haskell
-- UntypedWorld.fm
import Base#

main
  ((x) => x)("Hello, world!")
```

```shell
$ fm -t UntypedWorld
Can't infer non-annotated lambda.
- When checking (x) => x
- On line 5, col 11, file SameWorld.fm:
   1| -- SameWorld.fm
   2| import Base#
   3|
   4| main
   5|   ((x) => x)("Hello, world!")
   6|

$ fm -d UntypedWorld
"Hello, World"
```

Lambdas and applications can be erased with a `;`, which causes them to vanish
from the compiled output. This is useful, for example, to write polymorphic
functions without extra runtime costs. For example, on the code below, `eraser`
is compiled to `(x) => x`, and `main` is compiled to `eraser("Hello, world!")`.

```haskell
-- EraseWorld.fm
import Base#

eraser(T : Type; x : T) : T
  x

main : String
  eraser(String; "Hello, world!")
```

```shell
$ fm -t EraseWorld
String ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã

$ fm -t EraseWorld/eraser
(T : Type; x : T) -> T ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

The first argument disappears from the runtime

```haskell
$ fm -d EraseWorld/eraser
(x) => x
```

If you turn off the eraser by changing the `;` in `eraser` to `,`:

```haskell
no_eraser(T : Type, x : T) : T
  x
```

At runtime you get:

```haskell
$ fm -d EraseWorld/no_eraser
(T,x) => x
```

Number
------

A native number, encoded as a 64-bit value. It can be written in decimal, hexadecimal or binary:

```haskell
number_0 : Number
  1900

number_1 : Number
  0x76C

number_2 : Number
  0b11101101100

number_3 : Number
  12.3456

```

The numeric operations are:

name | syntax | javascript equivalent
--- | --- | ---
addition | `x + y` | `x + y`
subtraction | `x - y` | `x - y`
multiplication | `x * y` | `x * y`
division | `x / y` | `x / y`
modulus | `x % y` | `x % y`
exponentiation | `x ** y` | `x ** y`
bitwise-and | `x && y` | `x & y`
bitwise-or | `x || y` | `x \| y`
bitwise-xor | `x ^ y` | `x ^ y`
bitwise-not | `~(y)` | `~y`
bitwise-right-shift | `x >>> y` | `x >>> y`
bitwise-left-shift | `x << y` | `x << y`
greater-than | `x > y` | `x > y ? 1 : 0`
less-than | `x < y` | `x < y ? 1 : 0`
equals | `x === y` | `x === y ? 1 : 0`

There is no operator precedence: parenthesis are always placed on the right.
That means `3 * 10 + 1` is parsed as `3 * (10 + 1)`. If you want the
multiplication to occur first, you must be explicit:

```haskell
main : Number
  (3 * 10) + 1
```

There is also `if`, which allows branching with a `Number` condition.

syntax | description
--- | ---
`if n then a else b` | If `n` is `0`, evaluates to `b`, else, evaluates to `a`

Usage is straightforward:

```haskell
import Base#

main : IO(Unit)
  let age = 30

  if age < 18 then
    print("Boring teenager.")
  else
    print("Respect your elders!")
```

Let
---

Allows you to give local names to terms.

```haskell
-- LetWorld.fm
import Base#

main : String
  let hello = "Hello, world!"
  hello
```

`let` expressions can be infinitely nested.

```haskell
-- LetWorld2.fm
import Base#

main : String
  let output =
    let hello = "Hello, world!"
    hello
  output
```

`let` has no computational effect, it simply performs a parse-time substitution.

Self
----

Formality also has [Self
Types](http://homepage.divms.uiowa.edu/~astump/papers/fu-stump-rta-tlca-14.pdf),
which allow us to implement inductive datatypes with Œª-encodings:

| syntax            | description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `${self} T(self)` | `T` is a type that can access its own value              |
| `new(T) t`        | Constructs an instance of a `T` with value `t`           |
| `use(t)`          | Consumes self-type `t`, so its type can access its value |

Self Types allow a type to access *its own value*. This
allows us to do encode inductive datatypes with lambdas.
Since the language features syntax-sugars for those, you
probably won't need to use self-types directly, but it gives
us some interesting type-level powers, as will be explained
later.

Annotation
----------

You can also explicitly annotate the type of a term:

| syntax         | description                       |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|
| `term :: Type` | Annotates `term` with type `Type` |

This is useful when the type-checker can't infer the type of an expression.

```haskell
main : String
  (((x) => x) :: String -> String)("Hello, world!")
```

Note that an inline annotation uses `::` instead of `:`.
That's to distinguish it from top-level and case-expression
annotations.

Hole
----

Formality also features holes, which are very useful for development, debugging
and cleaning up type annotations from your code. A hole can be used to fill a
part of your program that you don't want to implement yet. It can be written
anywhere as `?name`, with the name being optional. If you give it a name, it
will cause Formality to print the type expected on the hole location, its
context (scope variables), and possibly a value, if Formality can fill it for
you. For example, the program below:

```haskell
-- Hole.fm
import Base#

main(x : Bool) : Bool
  or(true, ?a)
```

Will output:

```haskell
$ fm -t Hole
Found hole: 'a'.
- With goal... Bool
- With context:
- x : Bool

(x : Bool) -> Bool ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

This tells you that, on the location of the hole, you should have a `Bool`.
Note that this is only automatic if Formality can infer the expected type of
the hole's location. Otherwise, you must give it an explicit annotation, as in
`?hole :: MyType`.

When formality can infer the value of a hole for you, you don't need to complete
it; you can leave a `?` in your code. For example, below:

```haskell
import Base#

main : List(Bool)
  cons(?; true, nil(?;))
```

We don't need to write `Bool`, since Formality can infer that. We can leave it
as `?`. Since erased arguments are often inferrable, a `_` can be used as a
shortcut for `?;`, as in:

```haskell
import Base#

main : List(Bool)
  cons(_ true, nil(_))
```

Log
------

Another handy feature is `log(x)`. When running a program, it will print the
normal form of `x`, similarly to JavaScript's `console.log` and Haskell's `print`,
but for anything (not only strings). When type-checking a program, it tells you
the normal-form and the type of `x`. This is useful when you want to know what
type an expression would have inside certain context. For example:

```haskell
-- Log.fm
import Base#

main(f : Bool -> Nat) : Nat
  log(f(true))
  ?a
```

Type-checking the program above will cause Formality to output:

```shell
$ fm -t Log
[LOG]
Term: f(true)
Type: Nat

Found hole: 'a'.
- With goal... Nat
- Couldn't find a solution.
- With context:
- f : (: Bool) -> Nat

(f : (: Bool) -> Nat) -> Nat ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

This tells you that, inside the body of `main`, the type of `f(true)` is `Nat`.
Since it coincides with the goal, you can complete the program above with it:

```haskell
import Base#

main(f : Bool -> Nat) : Nat
  f(true)
```

Compile-time logs are extremely useful for development. We highly recommend
you to use them as much as possible!

Import
------

The `import` statement can be used to include local files. For example, save an
`Answers.fm` file in the same directory as `HelloWorld.fm`, with the following
contents:

```haskell
-- Answers.fm
import Base#

everything : String
  "42"
```

Then save a `Test.fm` file as:

```haskell
-- Test.fm
import Base#
import Answers

main : String
  everything
```

And run it with `fm -d Test/main`. You should see `"42"`.

If multiple imports have conflicting names, you can disambiguate with
`File/name`, or with a qualified import, using `as`:

```haskell
-- Alias.fm
import Base#
import Answers as A

main : String
  A/everything
```

Formality also has a file-based package manager. You can use it to share files
with other people. A file can be saved globally with `fm -s file`. This will
give it a unique name with a version, such as `file#7u3k`. Once given a unique
name, the file contents will never change, so `file#7u3k` will always refer to
that exact file. As soon as it is saved globally, you can import it from any
other computer. For example, remove `Answers.fm` and change `HelloWorld.fm` to:

```haskell
import Base#
import Answers#xxxx

main : String
  everything
```

This will load `Answers#xxxx.fm` inside the `fm_modules` directory and load it.
Any import ending with `#id` refers to a unique, immutable, permanent global
file. That prevents the infamous "dependency hell", and is useful for many
applications.

Right now, global imports are uploaded to our servers, but, in the future,
they'll upload files to decentralized storage such as [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)/[Swarm](https://ethersphere.github.io/swarm-home/), and given a
unique name using the [Ethereum Name Service](https://ens.domains).

Datatypes
=========

Formality includes a powerful datatype system. A new datatype can be defined
with the `T` syntax, which is similar to Haskell's `data`. It creates global
definitions for the type and its constructors. To pattern-match against a value
of a datatype, you must use a `case` expression.

Basics
------

Datatypes can be defined and used as follows:

```haskell
-- Suit.fm
import Base#

T Suit
| clubs
| diamonds
| hearts
| spades

suitMessage(suit : Suit) : String
  case suit
  | clubs    => "First rule: you do not talk about Fight Club."
  | diamonds => "Queen shines more than diamond."
  | hearts   => "You always had mine."
  | spades   => "The only card I need is the Ace of Spades! \m/"
  : String

main : IO(Unit)
  print(suitMessage(spades))
```

The program above creates a datatype, `Suit`, with 4 possible values. In
Formality, we call those values **constructors**. It then pattern-matches a
suit and outputs a different sentence depending on it. Notice that on this
`case` expression, we annotated the return type, `: IO(Unit)`. That's not
always necessary, but it is very important for theorem proving. The annotated
type of a case expression is called its [**motive**](#motive).

Fields
------

Datatype constructors can have fields, allowing them to store values:

```haskell
-- Person.fm
import Base#

T Person
| person(age : Nat, name : String)

getName(p : Person) : String
  case p | person p.name

main : IO(Unit)
  let john = person(27n, "John")
  print(getName(john))
```

As you can see, fields can be accessed inside `case` expressions. Notice that
`p.name` is not a field accessor, but just a single variable: the `.` is part
of its name. When Formality doesn't know the name of the matched value, you
must explicitly name it using the `as` keyword:

```haskell
main(p : Person) : Nat
  case person(27n, "John") as john | person 
  john.age
```

Move
----

Since Formality expressions can be incompatible with some
reductions strategies if they're not elementary (`‚Ñ∞`) or
affine (`ùíú`), sometimes you don't want to use an argument
more than once. For example, the function below uses `b` in
different branches:

```haskell
-- NonAffine.fm
import Base#

main(a : Bool, b : Bool) : Bool
  case a
  | true  => b
  | false => not(b)
```

But, since we used `b` in two different branches, we don't
need to copy it. We can, instead, tell Formality to move it
to each branch with the keyword `with`:

```haskell
-- Move.fm
import Base#

main(a : Bool, b : Bool) : Bool
  case a
  with b : Bool
  | true  => b
  | false => not(b)
```

This additional line can turn several exponential programs
into elementary or even affine.

Under the hood, this just adds an extra lambda on each branch:

```haskell
import Base#

main(a : Bool, b : Bool) : Bool
  (case a
  | true  => (b : Bool) => b
  | false => (b : Bool) => not(b))(b)
```

We recommend using `with` whenever possible, since it almost
always improves the performance of your programs, even in
compile targets that don't require affinity or elementarity.

Recursion
---------

Fields can refer to the datatype being defined:

```haskell
T Nat
| zero
| succ(pred : Nat)
```

This creates a recursive datatype. Since `Nat` is so common, there is a
syntax-sugar for it, `3n`, which expands to `succ(succ(succ(zero)))`.

Mutual recursion is allowed:

```haskell
T Foo
| foo(bar : Bar)

T Bar
| bar(foo : Foo)
```

Recursive functions can be written as usual:

```haskell
mul2(n : Nat) : Nat
  case n
  | zero => zero
  | succ => succ(succ(mul2(n.pred)))
  : Nat
```

Note: when writing mathematical proofs, you must make sure
your program terminates, otherwise, one can derive logical
paradoxes. Right now, Formality's termination checker is
very limited, but it will be improved.

While you can use recursive calls as much as you want, it is
wise to treat them as normal variables and use `with` to pass
them to branches. This can be a major optimization in some
cases. For example, when compiling to JavaScript, case-of
expressions become raw function applications (`val(case_a,
case_b, case_c)`). Since JS isn't lazy, every branch is
evaluated. If you use recursion on each branch, this will
make your JS program exponential. Using `with` prevents that:

```haskell
mul2(n : Nat) : Nat
  case n
  with mul2 : Nat -> Nat
  | zero => zero
  | succ => succ(succ(mul2(n.pred)))
  : Nat
```

Polymorphism
------------

Polymorphism allows us to create multiple instances of the same datatype with
different contained types.

```haskell
-- Polymorphism.fm
import Base#

--  Imported from Base
-- T Pair<A, B>
-- | pair(fst : A, snd : B)

main : Nat
  let a = pair(Bool; Nat; true, 7n)
  case a | pair 
  a.snd
```

The `<A, B>` syntax after the datatype declares two polymorphic Type variables,
`A` and `B`, allowing us to create pairs with different contained types without
having to write multiple `Pair` definitions. 

Each polymorphic variable adds an implicit, erased argument to each constructor,
so, instead of `pair(true, 7)`, you must write `pair(Bool; Nat; true, 7)`;
or, with holes, `pair(__ true, 7)`.

One of the most popular polymorphic types is the linked `List`:

```haskell
import Base#
-- List123.fm
-- Imported from Base
-- T List<A>
-- | nil
-- | cons(head : A, tail : List(A))

main : List(Nat)
  cons(_ 1n, cons(_ 2n, cons(_ 3n, nil(_))))
```

Notice we used holes to avoid having to write `Nat` repeatedly. Since lists
are so common, it is part of the Base library, and there is a built-in
syntax-sugar for them:

```haskell
-- NiceList.fm
import Base#

main : List(Nat)
  [1n, 2n, 3n]
```

Indices
-------

Indices are like polymorphic variables, except that, rather than constant
types, they are **computed values** that can depend on each constructor's
arguments. That gives us a lot of type-level power and is one of the reasons
Formality is a great proof language. For example:

```haskell
-- IsEven.fm
import Base#

T IsEven (x : Nat)
| isEven(half : Nat) : IsEven(mul(2n, half))

even0n : IsEven(0n)
  isEven(0n)

even2n : IsEven(2n)
  isEven(1n)

even4n : IsEven(4n)
  isEven(2n)

even_6n : IsEven(6n)
  isEven(3n)
```

This datatype has one index, `n`, of type `Nat`. Its constructor, `isEven`,
has one field, `half : Nat`. When you write `isEven(3n)`, the number `3n`
is multiplied by two and moved to the type-level, resulting in a value of type
`IsEven(6n)`. This makes it impossible to create a value of type `IsEven(5n)`,
because you'd need a `n` such that `mul(2n, n)` is `5n`, but that's impossible.

This allows us, for example, to create a `half` function that can only receive
even values:

```haskell
div2(n : Nat) : Nat
  case n
  | zero => zero
  | succ => case n.pred as np
    | zero => zero
    | succ => succ(div2(np.pred))
    : Nat
  : Nat

half(n : Nat, is_even : IsEven(n);) : Nat
  div2(n)
```

You can't call `half` on odd values because you can't construct an `IsEven` for
them. An good exercise might be to implement a proof of `Equal(Nat,
double(half(n, ie;)), n)`. Why this is possible for `half`, but not for `div2`?

Another example is the `Vector`, which is a `List` with a statically known length.
Every time you add an element to a `Vector`, the length on its type increases:

```haskell
-- Vector.fm
import Base#

T Vector{A} (len: Nat)
| vnil : Vector(A, zero)
| vcons(len; head: A, tail: Vector(A, len)) : Vector(A, succ(len))

main : Vector(String, 3n)
   vcons(__ "A", vcons(__ "B", vcons(__ "C", vnil(_))))
```

*TODO: Explain the difference between {} and ()*

This has many applications such as creating a type-safe `vhead` function that
can't be called on non-empty vectors.

As the last example, this defines a list with all elements being true:

```haskell
-- AllTrue.fm
import Base#

T AllTrue (xs : List(Bool))
| at_nil                                      : AllTrue(nil(Bool;))
| al_cons (xs : List(Bool), tt : AllTrue(xs)) : AllTrue(cons(Bool; true, xs))
```

It says that the empty list is a list of trues (`at_nil`) and that appending
true to a list of trues is still a list of trues (`at_cons`). It is impossible
to create a `AllTrue(list)` with a false element. You can make all sorts of
specifications using indexed datatypes, making them extremely powerful.

Motive
------

Until now, we've almost always omitted the type annotation of case expressions;
that is, its motive. But motives are important when you want the return type of
a case expression to depend on the matched value. For example:

```haskell
-- CaseType.fm
import Base#

CaseType(x : Bool) : Type
  case x
  | true  => Nat
  | false => String

main : Nat
  case true as x
  | true  => 42n
  | false => "hello"
  : CaseType(x)
```

The way this works is that, in order to check if a `case` expression is
well-typed, Formality first specializes the return type for the specific value
of each branch. For example, on the `true` case, `CaseType(true)` returns
`Nat`, so we can write `42`. On the `false` case, `CaseType(false)` returns
`String`, so we can write `"hello"`. Finally, the whole expression returns
`CaseType(x)`, which, in this case, is `Nat`, because `x` is `true`.

In other words, this means that, if we prove a theorem for every specific
possible value of `x`, then this theorem holds for `x` itself. This mechanism
is the heart of theorem proving, and understanding it well is essential to
develop mathematical proofs in Formality. Let's go through some examples.

#### Example: proving equalities

Formality's base libraries include a type for equality proofs called `Equal`.
For example, `Equal(Nat, 2n, 2n)` is the statement that `2` is equal `2`. It
is not a proof: you can write `Equal(Nat, 2n, 3n)`, which is just the
**statement** that `2` is equal to `3`. To prove an equality, you must use
`equal(A; x;)`, which, for any `x : A`, proves `Equal(A, x, x)`. In other
words, `equal` is a proof that every value is equal to itself. As such, we can
prove that `true` is equal to `true` like this:

```haskell
trueIsTrue : Equal(Bool, true, true)
  equal(Bool; true;)
```

Note that holes can often be used to avoid writing the arguments of `equal`.
Moreover, Formality includes a syntax sugar for `Equal`, `a == b`, which
expands to `Equal(?, a, b)`. As such, the program above can be written as:

```haskell
trueIsTrue : true == true
  equal(__)
```

A natural question is: if the only way to prove an equality is by using `equal`,
which proves that an element is equal to itself, then what is the point? The
insight is that, with motives, we can prove that two expressions are equal even
when they're not literally identical. For example, suppose you want to prove
that, for any boolean `b`, `not(not(b))` is equal to `b`. This can be stated as
such:

```haskell
-- TrueIsTrue.fm
import Base#

notNotIsSame(b : Bool) : Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)
  ?a
```

But here you can't use `equal(Bool; b;)`, because that'd be a proof of
`Equal(Bool, b, b)`, not of `Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)`. The sides aren't
identical! The problem is that the function call is stuck on a variable, `b`,
causing both sides to be different. That's when dependent motives help: if you
pattern-match on `b`, Formality will specialize the equation for both specific
values of `b`, that is, `true` and `false`:

```haskell
import Base#

notNotIsSame(b : Bool) : Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)
  case b
  | true  => ?a
  | false => ?b
  : Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)
```

So, on the `true` case, it asks you to prove `Equal(Bool, not(not(true)),
true)`, because `b` was specialized to true on that branch. Since
`not(not(true))` reduces to `true`, you only need to prove `Equal(Bool, true,
true)`, which can be done with `equal`. The same holds for the `false` case.
Once you prove the theorem for both possible cases of `b`, then Formality
returns the motive generalized for `b` itself:

```haskell
import Base#

notNotSame(b : Bool) : Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)
  case b
  | true  => equal(Bool; true;)
  | false => equal(Bool; false;)
  : Equal(Bool, not(not(b)), b)
```

This proof wouldn't be possible without using `b` on the motive. With syntax
sugars, it can be written as:

```haskell
main(b : Bool) : not(not(b)) == b
  case b
  | true  => equal(__)
  | false => equal(__)
  : not(not(b)) == b
```

#### Example: proving absurds

Another interesting example comes from the `Empty` datatype:

```haskell
T Empty
```

This code isn't incomplete, the datatype has zero constructors. This means it
is impossible to construct a term `t` with type `Empty`, but we can still
accept it as the type of a function argument. So, what happens if we pattern
match against it?

```haskell
import Base#

wtf(e : Empty) : ?
  case e : ?
```

Simple: we can replace `?` with anything, and the program will check. That's
because, technically, we proved all the cases, so the case expression just
returns the motive directly, allowing us to write anything on it! That can be
used to derive any theorem given a value of type Empty:

```haskell
-- OneIsTwo.fm
import Base#

OneIsTwo(e : Empty) : Equal(Nat, 1n, 2n)
  case e : Equal(Nat, 1n, 2n)
```

In other words, if we managed to call `one_is_two`, we'd have a proof that `1`
is equal to `2`. Of course, we can't call it, because there is no way to
construct a value of type `Empty`. Interestingly, the opposite holds too: given
a proof that `1` is equal to `2`, we can make an element of type `Empty`. Can
you prove this?

An interesting thing about `Empty` is that it can be used to prove that a
theorem is false by implementing a function that receives it as the input and
uses it to derive `Empty`. Our base libraries export many functions to help
you with that. For example:

- [`absurd`](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Empty.fm):
  allows you to prove any theorem from an `e : Empty`.

- [`true_isnt_false`](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Bool.fm):
  allows you to turn a proof that `true` is `false` into a proof of `Empty`.

- [`apply`](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Equal.fm):
  allows you to apply a function to both sides of an equation.

- [`rewrite`](https://github.com/moonad/Formality-Base/blob/master/Equal.fm):
  allows you to rewrite provably equal expressions inside types.


Those building blocks allow you to prove more complicate absurdities by
manipulating equations with higher level functions. For example, here is a
proof that `"dogs"` and `"horses"` are different strings:

```haskell
import Base#

main : "dogs" != "horses"
  (input) =>
  let e0 = input                         -- "dogs" == "horses"
  let e1 = apply(____ length(_); e0)     -- n4 == n6
  let e2 = apply(____ nat_equal(4n); e1) -- true == false
  let e3 = true_isnt_false(e2)           -- Empty
  e3
```

The `x != y` is a syntax sugar for `Not(Equal(?, x, y)`, where `Not` is a
function to `Empty`:

```haskell
Not(P) : Type
  (x : P) -> Empty
```


#### Example: avoiding unreachable branches

Notice the program below:

```haskell
import Base#

main : Nat
  case true
  | true  => 10n
  | false => ?
```

Here, we're matching against `true`, so we know the `false` case is
unreachable, but we still need to fill it with some number. With motives, we
can avoid that. The idea is that we will send, to each branch, a proof that
`Equal(Bool, x, true)`. On the `true` branch, it will be specialized to
`Equal(Bool, true, true)`, which is useless... but, on the `false` branch, it
will be specialized to `Equal(Bool, false, true)`. We can then use
`false_isnt_true` and `absurd` to fill the branch without ever providing a
number:
equal
```haskell
import Base#

main : Nat
  case true as x
  with equal(__) as e : x == true
  | true  => 10n
  | false => absurd(false_isnt_true(e), _)
```

(Remember that `with` is a shorthand for adding an extra variable to the motive.)

Of course, in this example we could just have written any number, but, in some
cases, such as on the `nil` branch of a `head` function, we simply don't have
a value to insert. In those cases, finding a way to construct `Empty` on that
branch is equivalent to saying it is unreachable. As such, `absurd` can be used
to "skip" it.

Encoding
--------

Interestingly, none of the features above are part of Formality's type theory.
Instead, they are lightweight syntax-sugars that elaborate to plain-old
lambdas. To be specific, a datatype is encoded as is own inductive hypothesis,
with "Self Types". For example, the `Bool` datatype desugars to:

```haskell
-- SelfBool.fm
Bool : Type
  ${self}
  ( P     : Bool -> Type;
    true  : P(true),
    false : P(false)
  ) -> P(self)

true : Bool
  new(Bool) (P; true, false) => true

false : Bool
  new(Bool) (P; true, false) => false

case_of(b : Bool, P : Bool -> Type; t : P(true), f : P(false)) : P(b)
  use(b)(P; t, f)
```

Here, `${self} ...`, `new(T) val` and `use(b)` are the type, introduction, and
elimination of Self Types, respectively. You can see how any datatype is
encoded under the hood by asking `fm` to weakly evaluate its type: 

```haskell
$ fm -dw SelfBool/Bool
${self} (P : (_ : Bool) -> Type; true : P(true), false : P(false)) -> P(self)
```


The `-w` flag asks Formality to not evaluate fully since `Bool` is recursive.
While you probably won't need to deal with self-encodings yourself, knowing how
they work is valuable, since it allows you to express types not covered by the
built-in syntax.

Proofs
======

Types in Formality can be used to express mathematical theorems. This allows us
to statically prove invariants about our programs. In a way, proofs can be seen
as a generalization of tests. With tests, we can assert that specific
expressions have the values we expect. For example, consider the program below:

```javascript
// Recursively doubles a number
function mul2(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    return 2 + mul2(n - 1);
  }
}

// Tests
it("Works for 1", () => {
  console.assert(mul2(1) === 2);
})


it("Works for 2", () => {
  console.assert(mul2(2) === 4);
});

it("Works for 4", () => {
  console.assert(mul2(4) === 8);
});

```

It allows us to test our implementation of `mul2` by checking if the invariant
that `n * 2` is equal to `n + n` holds for specific values of `n`. The problem
with this approach is that it only gives us partial confidence. No matter how
many tests we write, there could be still some input which causes our function
to misbehave.

```javascript
function mul2(n) {
  if (n <= 0) {
    return 0;
  } else {
    if (n == 200) { return 398; }
    else { return 2 + mul2(n - 1); }
  }
}
```

In this example, `mul2(200)` returns `398`, which is different
from `200 + 200`. The implementation is incorrect, despite all the previous
tests passing!

With formal proofs, we can write tests too:

```haskell
-- MulTests.fm
import Base#

mul2(n : Nat) : Nat
  case n
  | zero => zero
  | succ => succ(succ(mul2(n.pred)))

worksFor0 : mul2(0n) == 0n
  equal(__)

worksFor1 : mul2(1n) == 2n
  equal(__)

worksFor2 : mul2(2n) == 4n
  equal(__)
```


Here, we're using `==` to make an assertion that `mul2(1)` is equal to `2` and
so on. Since those are true by reduction, we can complete the proofs with
`equal`. This essentially implements a type-level test suite. But with proofs,
we can go further: we can prove that a general property holds for every possible
input, not just a few.

We can try to prove the more general statement that the double of any `n` is
equal to `add(x,x)`. We start by writing the type of our invariant:

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  ?a
```

As you can see, this is just like a test, except that it includes a variable,
`n`, which can be any `Nat`. As such, it will only "pass" if we manage to
convince Formality that `mul2(n) == add(n, n)` holds for every `n`,
not just a few. To do it, we can start by type-checking the program above and
seeing what Formality has to say:

```shell
Found hole: 'a'.
- With goal... Equal(Nat, mul2(n), add(n, n))
- With context:
- n : Nat

(n : Nat) -> Equal(Nat, mul2(n), add(n, n)) ‚úî ùíú ‚Ñ∞ ‚Ñã
```

This is telling us that our theorem is correct as long as we can replace the
hole `?a` with a proof that `mul2(n) == add(n, n)`. In other words,
Formality is asking us to prove what we claimed to be true. Let's try to do
it with a `equal`:

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  equal(__)
```

This time, it doesn't work, and we get the following error:

```shell
Type mismatch.
- Found type... Equal(Nat, add(n, n), add(n, n))
- Instead of... Equal(Nat, mul2(n), add(n, n))
```

That's because `equal` proves that a value is equal to itself, but `mul2(n)` and
`add(n, n)` are different expressions. The problem is that, unlike on the
previous tests, the equation now has a variable, `n`, which causes both sides to
get "stuck", so they don't become identical by mere reduction. We need to
"unstuck" the equation by inspecting the value of `n` with a case expression.

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  case n
  | zero => ?a
  | succ => ?b
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

Let's type-check it again:

```haskell
Found hole: 'a'.
- With goal... Equal(Nat, mul2(zero), add(zero, zero))
- Couldn't find a solution.
- With context:
- n : Nat

Found hole: 'b'.
- With goal... Equal(Nat, mul2(succ(n.pred)), add(succ(n.pred), succ(n.pred)))
- Couldn't find a solution.
- With context:
- n      : Nat
- n.pred : Nat
```

Notice that, now, we have two holes, one for each possible value of `n` (`zero`
or `succ(n.pred)`). The first hole is now asking a proof that `Equal(Nat,
mul2(zero), add(zero, zero))`. See how it was specialized to the value of `n`
on the branch? That's very important, because now both sides evaluate to
`zero`. This allows us to prove that case with a `equal`!

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  case n
  | zero => equal(__)
  | succ => ?b
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

Now, we only have one hole:

```haskell
Found hole: 'b'.
- With goal... Equal(Nat, mul2(succ(n.pred)), add(succ(n.pred), succ(n.pred)))
- Couldn't find a solution.
- With context:
- n      : Nat
- n.pred : Nat
```

This demands a proof that `Equal(Nat, mul2(succ(n.pred)), add(succ(n.pred),
succ(n.pred)))`. Due to the way `mul2` and `add` are defined, this reduces to
`Equal(Nat, succ(succ(mul2(n.pred))), succ(succ(add(n.pred, succ(n.pred)))))`,
so that's what we need to prove. This looks... complex. But, since we're in a
recursive branch, there is a cool thing we can do: call the function
recursively to the predecessor of `n`. That's the mathematical equivalent of
applying the inductive hypothesis, and it is almost always the key to proving
theorems about recursive datatypes like `Nat`. Let's do that and `log` it to
see what we get:

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  case n
  | zero => equal(__)
  | succ =>
    let indHyp = worksForAllN(n.pred)
    log(indHyp)
    ?a
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

This outputs:

```shell
[LOG]
Term: worksForAllN(n.pred)
Type: Equal(Nat, mul2(n.pred), add(n.pred, n.pred))
```

In other words, we gained "for free" a proof, `ind_hyp`, that `Equal(Nat,
mul2(n.pred), add(n.pred, n.pred))`! Now, remember that our goal is `Equal(Nat,
succ(succ(mul2(n.pred))), succ(succ(add(n.pred, succ(n.pred)))))`. Take a
moment to observe that, to turn `ind_hyp` into our goal, all we need to do is
add `succ(succ(...))` to both sides of the equation. This can be done with the
`cong` function from the Base library. That function accepts an equality and a
function, and applies the function to both sides of the equality. Like this:

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
  case n
  | zero => equal(__)
  | succ =>
    let indHyp = worksForAllN(n.pred)
    let addTwo = (x : Nat) => succ(succ(x))
    let newHyp = apply(____ addTwo; indHyp)
    log(newHyp)
    ?a
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

Let's log `new_hyp` to see what we have now:

```haskell
[LOG]
Term: cong(?_a/line24_11; ?_a/line24_12; ?_a/line24_13; ?_a/line24_14; (x : Nat) => succ(succ(x)); worksForAllN(n.pred))
Type: Equal(Nat, succ(succ(mul2(n.pred))), succ(succ(add(n.pred, n.pred))))
```

As you can see, `new_hyp` has the same type as our goal! As such, we can
complete this branch with it:

```haskell
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : Equal(Nat, mul2(n), add(n, n))
  case n
  | zero => equal(__)
  | succ =>
    let ind_hyp = worksForAllN(n.pred)
    let add_two = (x : Nat) => succ(succ(x))
    let new_hyp = apply(____ add_two; ind_hyp)
    new_hyp
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

And done! Since we've proven our theorem for both possible values of `n`
(`zero` or `succ(n.pred)`), then we've proven it for every `n`. And that's how
most proofs are done. Proving an equation is often just a game of "opening"
variables with `case` expressions so that the sides gets unstuck until we're
able to finish the proof with a `equal`, or with an inductive hypothesis.

The cool thing is, since our program passes the type-checker now, that means
we've proven that `2 * n` is equal to `n + n` for all `n`. This is an extreme
validation that our implementation of `mul2` is correct: it is as if we've
written infinite tests, one for each `n`. Not only that, but the fact that
`mul2` and `add` match perfectly despite being very different functions
reinforces the correctness of them both, mutually. Here is the complete file
with our implementation and its correctness proof:

```haskell
-- MulTests.fm
import Base#

-- Multiplies a number by two
mul2(n : Nat) : Nat
  case n
  | zero => zero
  | succ => succ(succ(mul2(n.pred)))

-- Tests that it works as expected for `n = 0`
worksFor0 : mul2(0n) == 0n
  equal(__)

-- Tests that it works as expected for `n = 1`
worksFor1 : mul2(1n) == 2n
  equal(__)

-- Tests that it works as expected for `n = 2`
worksFor2 : mul2(2n) == 4n
  equal(__)

-- Proves that it works as expected for any `n` up to infinity
-- using symbolic manipulation and inductive reasoning
worksForAllN(n : Nat) : Equal(Nat, mul2(n), add(n, n))
  case n
  | zero => equal(__)
  | succ =>
    let indHyp = worksForAllN(n.pred)
    let addTwo = (x : Nat) => succ(succ(x))
    let newHyp = apply(____ addTwo; indHyp)
    newHyp
  : mul2(n) == add(n, n)
```

An interesting point to note is that proofs are often much longer than
theorems. In this example, the theorem had just one line, but the proof had 8.
Proofs are laborious to write and require a set of advanced programming skills.
But, once they're done, they're undeniably correct (assuming the proof
terminates). This is extremely valuable. For example, think of a huge smart-contract: its code could be big and complex, but, as long as its developers publish proofs of a few essential
properties, users can trust it won't go wrong. In a way, proofs can be seen as
trustless correctness assets, in the sense, you can use them to convince people
that your code is correct without needing them to trust you.

Theory
======


**Todo: This theory section is obsolete and must be written**

Formality is a dependently typed programming language based on extrinsic type
theory. It is based on elementary terms are just annotated versions of the
Elementary Affine Calculus (EAC), which is itself a terminating subset
of the lambda-calculus with great computational characteristics. In particular,
EAC is compatible with the most efficient version of the optimal reduction
algorithm [citation]. This is important because, while asymptotically optimal,
most implementations of the algorithm carry an extra, significant constant
overhead caused by a book-keeping machinery. This made them too slow in
practice, decreasing interest in the area. By relying on EAC, we can avoid the
book-keeping overhead, making it much faster than all alternatives. Below is a
table comparing the number of native operations (graph rewrites) required to
reduce Œª-terms in other implementations and Formality:

 Term | GeomOpt | GeomImpl | YALE | IntComb | Formality
  --- |     --- |      --- |  --- |     --- |       ---
 22II |     204 |       56 |   38 |      66 |        21
222II |     789 |      304 |  127 |     278 |        50
  3II |      75 |       17 |   17 |      32 |         9
 33II |     649 |      332 |   87 |     322 |        49
322II |    7055 |     4457 |  383 |    3268 |        85
223II |    1750 |     1046 |  213 |     869 |        69
 44II |    3456 |     2816 |  148 |    2447 |        89

Not only Formality requires orders of magnitude less native operations, but its
native operations are much simpler.

Unlike most proof languages, Formality doesn't include a datatype system, since
not only it is very complex to implement, which goes against our second goal
(simplicity), but can also cause more serious issues. For example, it was
discovered that type preservation does not hold in Coq due to its treatment of
coinductive datatypes [citation], and both Coq and Agda were found to be
incompatible with Homotopy Type Theory due to the K-axiom, used by native
pattern-matching on dependent datatypes [citation]. Instead, Formality relies
on lambda encodings, an alternative to a datatype system that uses plain lambdas
to encode arbitrary data. While attractive, this approach wasn't adopted in
practical type theories for several reasons:

1. There is no encoding that provides both recursion and fast pattern-matching.

    - Church encodings provide recursion, but pattern-matching is slow (`O(n)`).

    - Scott encodings provide fast pattern-matching, but no recursion.

    - Alternative encodings that provide both consume too much memory.

2. We cannot prove `0 != 1` with the usual definition of `!=`.

3. Induction is not derivable.

Formality solves the first issue by simply using Church encodings for recursion
and Scott encodings for data, the second issue by collapsing universes, and the
last issue by combining self-types and type-level recursion [citation]. It is
well-known that, in most proof languages, collapsing universes and type-level
recursion can lead to logical paradoxes, but the remarkable coincidence is that
the same feature that allows the language to be compatible with optimal
reductions, Elementary Affine Logic, also makes its type-theory sound in the
presence of those [proof]. This allows the theory to be remarkably simple and
powerful.

Formality Core
--------------

Formality Core (FM-Core) can be seen as a distillation of FM-Lang with just the
most essential primitives, excluding aspects such as datatypes, which are
implemented with more primitive features such as lambdas and self. Its syntax
is defined as follows:

```
name ::=
  <any alphanumeric string>

term ::=
  -- Lambdas
  (name : term) -> term -- lambda type (dependent product)
  (name : term) => term -- lambda term
  term(term)            -- lambda application

  -- Self-Types
  ${name} term           -- self type
  new(term) term         -- self term
  use(term)              -- self elimination

  -- Language
  name                   -- variable
  Type                   -- universe

file ::=
  name term : term; file -- top-level definition
  \eof                   -- end-of-file
```

We'll use the Formality notation and write `(x0 : A0, x1, A1, ...) => t` as a
synonym for `(x0 : A0) => (x1 : A1) => ...  => t`, and `f(x,y,z)` as a synonym
for `f(x)(y)(z)`. When `x` isn't used in `B`, we'll write `(x : A) -> B` as `A
-> B` instead. We will also sometimes omit types of lambda-bound arguments when
they can be inferred and write `(x0) => t` instead.  Our typing rules are:

```
-- Lambdas

Œì |- A : Type    Œì, x : A |- B : Type
------------------------------------- lambda type
Œì |- (x : A) -> B : Type

Œì |- A : Type    Œì, x : A |- t : B
---------------------------------- lambda term
Œì |- (x : A) => t : (x : A) -> B

Œì |- f : (x : A) -> B    Œì |- a : A
----------------------------------- lambda application
Œì |- f(a) : B[x <- a]

-- Self-Types

Œì, s : ${x} A |- A : Type
------------------------- self type
Œì |- ${x} A : Type

Œì, |- t : A[x <- t]    Œì |- ${x} A : Type
----------------------------------------- self term
Œì |- new(${x} A) t : ${x} A

Œì |- t : ${x} A
----------------------- self elimination
Œì |- use(t) : A[x <- t]

-- Language

(x : T) ‚àà Œì
----------- variable
Œì |- x : T

√ò
---------------- type-in-type
Œì |- Type : Type
```

**Theorem: induction principle.**

Induction can be proved on FM-Core as follows:

```
Nat : Type
  ${self}
  ( P    : Nat -> Type
  , succ : (r : Nat, i : P(r)) -> P(succ(r))
  , zero : P(zero)
  ) -> P(self)

succ : (n : Nat) -> Nat
  new(Nat) (P, succ, zero) => succ(n, use(n)(P, succ, zero))

zero : Nat
  new(Nat) (P, succ, zero) => zero

nat_ind : (n : Nat, P : Nat -> Type, s : (n : Nat, i : P(n)) -> P(succ(n)), z : P(zero)) -> P(n)
  (n) => use(n)
```

This defines an inductive lambda encoded datatype, Nat. The key to understand
why this works is to realize that `Nat` is defined as its own induction scheme.
Mutual recursion is needed because the induction scheme of any datatype refers
to its constructors, which then refer to the defined datatype. Self types are
used because the type returned by the induction scheme can refer to the term
being induced. Together, those two components allow us to define inductive
datatypes with just plain lambdas, and to induce on `n : Nat` you don't require
any additional proof, all you need to do is eliminate its self-type with `use(n)`.
Note that this `Nat` is complicated by the fact it is recursive (Church
encoded). We could have a non-recursive (Scott encoded) `Nat` as:

```javascript
Nat Type
  ${self} (
    P    : Nat -> Type;
    succ : (n : Nat) -> P(succ(n)),
    zero : P(zero)
  ) -> P(self)

succ(n : Nat) -> Nat
  new(Nat) (P; succ, zero) => succ(n)

zero Nat
  new(Nat) (P; succ, zero) => zero

nat_ind(n : Nat, P : Nat -> Type; s : (n : Nat, i : P(n)) -> P(succ(n)), z : P(zero)) -> P(n)
  (n) => use(n)
```

Which is simpler and has the benefit of having constant-time pattern-matching.
Even simpler types include Bool:

```
Bool Type
  ${self} (
    P     : Bool -> Type;
    true  : P(true),
    false : P(false)
  ) -> P(self)

true Bool
  new(Bool) (P; true, false) => true

false Bool
  new(Bool) (P; true, false) => false

bool_induction(b : Bool, P : Bool -> Type; t : P(true), f : P(false)) -> P(b)
  (b) => use(b)
```

Unit:

```
Unit Type
  ${self}
  ( P     : Unit -> Type;
    unit  : P(unit)
  ) -> P(self)

unit Unit
  new(Unit) (P; unit) => unit

unit_induction(b : Unit, P : Unit -> Type; u : P(unit)) -> P(u)
  (u) => use(u)
```

And Empty:

```
Empty Type
  ${self} (
    P : Empty -> Type;
  ) -> P(self)

empty_induction(b : Empty, P : Empty -> Type;) -> P(b)
  (e) => use(e)
```

Notice how, for example, `bool_induction` is equivalent to the elimination
principle of the Bool datatype on Coq or Agda, except that this was obtained
without needing a complex datatype system to be implemented as a native
language feature. This type theory is capable of expressing any inductive
datatype seen on traditional proof languages. For example, Vector (a List with
statistically known length) can, too, be encoded as its dependent elimination:

```
Vector(A : Type; len : Nat) -> Type
  ${self} (
    P     : (len : Nat) -> Vector(A, len) -> Type;
    vcons : (len : Nat; x : A, xs : Vector(A, len)) -> P(succ(len), vcons(A; len; x, xs)),
    vnil  : P(zero, vnil(A;)),
  ) -> P(len, self)

vcons(A : Type; len : Nat; head : A, tail : Vector(A, len)) -> Vector(A, succ(len))
  new(Vector(A, succ(len))) (P; vcons, vnil) => vcons(len; head, tail)

vnil(A : Type;) -> Vector(A, zero)
  new(Vector(A, zero)) (P; vcons, vnil) => vnil
```

And an identity type for propositional equality is just the J axiom wrapped by
a self type:

```
Id(A : Type, a : A, b : A) -> Type
  ${self} (
    P    : (b : A, eq : Id(A, a, b)) -> Type;
    equal : P(a, equal(A; a;))
  ) -> P(b, self)

equal(A : Type; a : A;) -> Id(A, a, a)
  new(Id(A, a, a)) (P; equal) => equal
```

And we can easily prove troublesome theorems like `0 != 1`: 

```
true_isnt_false(e : Id(Bool, true, false)) -> Empty
  use(e)((b, e.b) => use(e.b)((b) => Type; Unit, Empty); unit)
```

That much type-level power comes at a cost: if Formality was based on the
conventional lambda calculus, it wouldn't be sound. Since it is based on EAC,
a terminating untyped language, its normalization is completely independent
of types, so it is impossible to derive paradoxes by exploiting
non-terminating computations. A good exercise is attempting to write `Œªx. (x x)
Œªx. (x x)` on EAC, which is impossible. The tradeoff is that EAC is
considerably less computationally powerful than the lambda calculus, imposing
a severe restriction on how terms can be duplicated. This limitation isn't very
problematic in practice since the language is still capable of implementing any
algorithm a normal programming language, but doing so involves a resource-usage
discipline that can be annoying to users. Formality is currently being
implemented in Agda, on which the consistency argument will be formalized.

TODO: complete with consistency proofs (being developed on the
[Formality-Agda](https://github.com/moonad/formality-agda) repository).


Formality Calculus
------------------

The Formality Calculus (FM-Calc) is a further distillation of FM-Core, without
types. It is similar to the Œª-calculus, but it is both terminating and
compatible with the book-keeping free optimal reduction algorithm used by
our runtime.

```
name ::=
  <any alphanumeric string>


term ::=
  -- Lambdas
  (name) => term        -- lambda term
  term(term)            -- lambda application

  -- Language
  name                  -- variable
```

The actual implementation of FM-Calc also features numbers and pairs, which are
omitted here for simplicity.  The first 3 constructors are the usual
Œª-calculus. The FM-Calc has the following reduction rules:

```
1. application: ((x) => a)(b) ~> [b/x]a
```

The first rule is the usual beta-reduction. An FM-Calc term is said to be stratified when it follows the
following conditions:

1. Lambda-bound variables can only be used at most once.


- Define the level of a term as the number of boxes surrounding it.

Formality Net
-------------

Formality terms are compiled to a memory-efficient interaction net system,
FM-Net. Interaction nets are just graphs where nodes have labeled ports, one
being the main one, plus a list of "rewrite rules" that are activated whenever
two nodes are connected by their main ports. Our system includes 6 types of
nodes, ERA, CON, OP1, OP2, ITE, NUM.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-node-types.png)

- `CON` has 3 ports and an integer label. It is used to represent lambdas,
  applications, boxes (implicitly) and duplications. Since FM-Core is based on
  EAL, there is no book-keeping machinery to keep track of Bruijn indices, just
  `CON` is enough for beta-reduction.

- `ERA` has 1 port and is used to free empty memory, which happens when a
  function that doesn't use its bound variable is applied to an argument.

- `NUM` has 1 port and stores an integer and is used to represent native
  numbers.

- `OP1` has 2 ports and stores one integer and an operation id. `OP2` has 3
  ports and an operation id. They are used for numeric operations such as
  addition and multiplication.

- `ITE` has 3 ports and an integer label. It is used for if-then-else and is
  required to enable number-based branching.

Note that the position of the port matters. The port on top is called the `main`
port. The first port counter-clockwise to the main port (i.e., to the left on
this drawing) is the `aux0` port, and the first port clockwise to the main port
(i.e., to the right on this drawing) is the `aux1` port.

#### Rewrite rules

In order to perform computations, FM-Net has a set of rewrite rules that are
triggered whenever two nodes are connected by their main ports. This is an
extensive list of those rules:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-rewrite-rules.png)

Note that, while there are many rules (since we need to know what to do on each
combination of a node), most of those have the same "shape" (such as OP2-OP2,
ITE-ITE), so they can reuse the same code. There are only 5 actually relevant
rules:

#### Erasure

When an `ERA` or a `NUM` node collides with anything, it "destroys" the other
node, and propagates itself to destroy all nodes connected to it.

#### Substitution

When two `CON` nodes of equal label collide, and also on the `OP2-OP2` /
`ITE-ITE` cases, both nodes are destroyed, and their neighbors are connected.
That's the rule that performs beta-reduction because it allows connecting the
body of a lambda (which is represented with `CON`) to the argument of an
application (which is, too, represented with `CON`). Note that on the OP2-OP2
and ITE-ITE cases, that's just a default rule that doesn't matter, since those
cases can't happen on valid FM-Calc programs.

#### Duplication

When different nodes collide, they "pass-through" each other, duplicating
themselves in the process. This allows, for example, `CON` nodes with a label
`>1` to be used to perform deep copies of any term, with `dup x = val; ...`. It
can copy lambdas and applications because they are represented with `CON` nodes
with a label `0`, pairs and pair-accessors, because they are represented with
`CON` nodes with a label `1`, and `ITE`, `OP1`, `OP2`, because they are
different nodes.

It also allows duplications to duplicate terms that are partially duplicated
(i.e., which must duplicate, say, a Œª-bound variable), as long as the `CON`
labels are different, otherwise, the `CON` nodes would instead fall in the
substitution case, destroying each other and connecting neighbors, which isn't
correct. That's why FMC's box system is necessary: to prevent concurrent
duplication processes to interfere with each other by ensuring that, whenever
you duplicate a term with `dup x = val; ...`, all the duplication `CON` nodes of
`val` will have labels higher than the one used by that `dup`.

#### If-Then-Else

When an `ITE` node collides with a `NUM` node, it becomes a `CON` node with one
of its ports connected to an `ERA` node. That's because then/else branches are
actually stored in a pair, and this allows you to select either the `fst` or the
`snd` value of that pair and discard the other branch.

#### Num-Operation

When `OP2` collides with a `NUM`, it becomes an `OP1` node and stores the number
inside it; i.e., the binary operation becomes a unary operation with `NUM`
partially applied. When that `OP1` collides with another `NUM`, then it performs
the binary operation on both operands, and return a new `NUM` with the result.
Those rules allow us to add, multiply, divide and so on native numbers.

#### Implementation

In our implementation, we use a buffer of 32-bit unsigned integers to represent
nodes, as follows:

- `CON`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 3 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The last one represents the node type (3 bits),
  whether its ports are pointers or unboxed numbers (3 bits), and the label (26
  bits).

- `OP1`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first and third represent
  the `main` and `aux0` ports. The second represents the stored number. The
  last one represents the node type (2 bits), whether its ports are pointers
  or unboxed numbers (3 bits, 1 unused), and the operation (26 bits).

- `OP2`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 3 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The last one represents the node type (3 bits),
  whether its ports are pointers or unboxed numbers (3 bits), and the operation
  (26 bits).

- `ITE`: represented by 4 consecutive uints. The first 3 represent the `main`,
  `aux0` and `aux1` ports. The last one represents the node type (3 bits),
  whether its ports are pointers or unboxed numbers (3 bits), and the label
  (26 bits).

- `ERA`: is stored inside other nodes and does not use any extra space. An `ERA`
  node is represented by a pointer port that points to itself. That's because
  `ERA`'s rewrite rules coincide with what we'd get if we allowed ports to point
  to themselves.

- `NUM`: is stored inside other nodes and does not use any extra space. A `NUM`
  node is represented by a numeric port. In order to know if a port is a number
  or a pointer, each node reserves 3 bits of its last uint to store that
  information.

#### Rewrites

TODO: explain how `rewrite` works, how `link_ports` is used, and why
`unlink_ports` is necessary to avoid invalid states.

#### Strict evaluation

The strict evaluation algorithm is very simple. First, we must keep a set of
redexes, i.e., nodes connected by their main ports. In order to do that,
whenever we link two main ports, we must add the address of the smallest nodes
to that set. We then perform a loop to rewrite all redexes. This will give us a
new set of redexes, which must then be reduced again, over and over, until there
are no redexes left. This is the pseudocode:

```python
while (len(net.redexes) > 0):
  for redex in net.redexes:
    net.rewrite(redex)
```

The strict reduction is interesting because it doesn't require graph walking nor
garbage collection passes, and because the inner `for`-loop can be performed in
parallel. That is, every `redex` in `net.redexes` can be rewritten at the same
time.

In order to do that, though, one must be cautious with intersection areas. For
example, in the graph below, B-C and D-E are redexes. If we reduce them in
parallel, both threads will attempt to read/write from C's and D's `aux0` and
`aux1` ports, potentially causing synchronization errors.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_problem_2x.png)

This can be avoided through locks, or by performing rewrites in two steps. On
the first step, each thread reads/writes the ports of its own active pair as
usual, except that, when it would need to connect a neighbor, it instead turns
its own node into a "redirector" which points to where the neighbor was supposed
to point. For example, substitution and duplication would be performed as
follows:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_local_rewrites_2x.png)

Notice that `P`, `Q`, `R` and `S` (neighbor ports) weren't touched: they keep
pointing to the same ports, but now those ports point to where they should point
to. Then, a second parallel step is performed. This time, we spawn a thread for
each neighbor port and walk through the graph until we find a non-redirector
node. We then point that neighbor to it. Here is a full example:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/Absal/sk_local_rewrites_ex_2x.png)

Notice, for example, the port `C` of the node `A`. It is on the neighborhoods of
a redex (`B-C`), but isn't a redex itself. On the first step, two threads
rewrite the nodes `B-C` and `D-E`, turning them into redirectors, and without
touching that port. On the second step, a thread starts from port `C` of node
`A`, towards port `B` of node `B` (a redirector), towards port `C` of node `D`
(a redirector), towards port `B` of node ` F`. Since that isn't a redirector,
the thread will make `C` point to `B`. The same is done for each neighbor port
(in parallel), completing the parallel reduction.

#### Lazy evaluation

The lazy evaluation algorithm is very different from the strict one. It works by
traversing the graph, exploring it to find redexes that are "visible" on the
normal form of the term, skipping unnecessary branches. It is interesting
because it allows avoiding wasting work; for example, `({a b}b (F 42) 7)` would
quickly evaluate to `7`, no matter how long `(F 42)` takes to compute. In
exchange, it is "less parallel" than the strict algorithm (we can't reduce all
redexes since we don't know if they're necessary), and it requires global
garbage collection (since erasure nodes are ignored).

To skip unnecessary branches, we must walk through the graph from  port to port,
using a strategy very similar to the denotational semantics of symmetric
interaction combinators. First, we start walking from the root port to its
target port. Then, until we get back to the root, do as follows:

1. If we're walking from an aux port towards an aux port of a node, add the aux
   we're coming from to a stack, and move towards the main port of that node.

2. If we're walking from a main port to an auxiliary port, then we just found a
   node that is part of the normal form of the graph! If we're performing a
   weak-head normal form reduction, stop. Otherwise, start walking towards each
   auxiliary port (either recursively, or in parallel).

3. If we're walking towards the root, halt.

This is a rough pseudocode:

```python
def reduce_lazy(net, start):
  back = []
  prev = start
  next = net.enter(prev)

  while not(net.is_root(next)):
    if slot_of(prev) == 0 and slot_of(next) == 0:
      net.rewrite(prev, next)
    elif slot_of(next) == 0:
      for aux_n from 0 til net.aux_ports_of(next):
        net.reduce_lazy(Pointer(node_of(next), aux_n))
    else:
      back.push(prev)
      prev = Pointer(node_of(next), 0)
      next = net.enter(prev)
```

While the lazy algorithm is inherently sequential, there is still an opportunity
to explore parallelism whenever we find a node that is part of the normal form
of the graph (i.e., case `2`). In that case, we can spawn a thread to walk
towards each auxiliary port in parallel; i.e., the `for`-loop of the pseudocode
can be executed in parallel like the one on the strict version. This would allow
the algorithm to have many threads walking through the graph at the same time.
Again, caution must be taken to avoid conflicts.

Net-Compilation
---------------

The process of compiling a Formality program to an interaction net can be
summarized as:

```
FM-Lang -> FM-Core -> FM-Calc -> FM-Net
```

That is, the user-facing textual syntax, FM-Lang, is desugared into a simple
type-theory, FM-Core, which is type-checked. If checking succeeds, types are
erased, turning it into FM-Calc, which is then compiled to FM-Net. The process
of compiling FM-Calc to FM-Net can be defined by the following function
`k_b(net)`:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moonad/Assets/master/images/fm-net-compilation.png)

This function recursively walks through a term, creating nodes and "temporary
variables" (`x_b`) in the process. It also keeps track of the number of boxes it
passed through, `b`. For example, on the lambda (`{x}f`) case, the procedure
creates a `CON` node with a label `0`, creates a "temporary variable" `x_b` on
the `aux0` port, recurses towards the body of the function, `f` on the `aux1`
port, and then returns the `main` port (because there is a black ball on it).
Notice that there isn't a case for `VAR`. That's what those "temporary
variables" are for. On the `VAR` case, two things can happen:

1. If the corresponding "temporary variable" `x_b` was never used, simply return
   a pointer to it.

2. If the corresponding "temporary variable" `x_b` was used, create a "CON" node
   with a label `2 + b`, connect its main port to the old location of `x_b`, its
   `aux0` to the port `x_b` pointed to, and return a pointer to its `aux1` port.

This process allows us to create as many `CON` nodes as needed to duplicate
`dup`-bound variables, and labels those nodes with the layer of that `dup` (plus
2, since labels 0 and 1 are used for lambdas/applications and
pairs/projections). Note that this process is capable of duplicating Œª-bound
variables, but this isn't safe in practice, and won't happen in well-typed
inputs.
