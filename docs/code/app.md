# App

The `app` directory is an essential part of the Kind project structure. It contains the main entry point of the application, typically a `Main.hs` file.

## Structure

The `app` directory usually includes:

- `Main.hs`: The main file containing the `main` function, which is the entry point of the Kind application.

## Purpose

The purpose of the `app` directory is to:

1. Separate the main application code from the library code.
2. Contain the initialization and configuration logic of the application.
3. Provide a clear entry point for program execution.

## Usage

The code in the `app` directory typically imports and utilizes the functionalities defined in the `src` directory, combining them to create the complete application.

For more details on the specific content and implementation, refer to the `Main.hs` file within this directory.
