## Elementary Affine Net (EA-NET)

An efficient interaction net system which can be seen as [Symmetric-Interaction-Combinators](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1731/a6e49c6c2afda3e72256ba0afb34957377d3.pdf), extended with node labels. It is desirable for being capable of reducing [EA-CORE](https://github.com/moonad/elementary-affine-core) terms optimally. It is designed to be simple and easy to formalize. When extended with primitive numbers, it becomes [FM-NET](https://github.com/moonad/formality-net).
