Goodbye, JavaScript!
====================

Formality has now received its largest and most important update to date: it is
now entirely implemented in itself! Its parser, type-checker, interpreter and so
on are all contained in a pure Formality file,
[Fm.fm](https://github.com/moonad/FormalityFM/blob/master/src/Fm.fm). That file
is then compiled to multiple back-ends, including
[JavaScript](https://github.com/moonad/FormalityFM/blob/master/bin/js/src/formality.js),
[Haskell](https://github.com/moonad/FormalityFM/blob/master/bin/hs/src/FormalityInternal.hs)
and, in a future, Scheme, Clojure and others. That means that:

1. Your Formality libraries can now be imported inside multiple languages.

2. Formality itself can be installed using multiple package managers.

Our dependence on JavaScript is finally over and the jump in code quality is
unprecedented, since the language is rewritten in a very strongly typed
language: itself! That marks the beginning of a new era for Formality, where it
moves from being a research project towards becoming a mature, stable and
productive language.

Installing Formality from `npm` or `cabal`
------------------------------------------

Usually, Formality is installed from `npm`, using `npm i -g formality-js`. This
installs a big JavaScript file
([formality.js](https://github.com/moonad/Formality/blob/master/bin/js/src/formality.js))
containing the whole language, and exposes it via the `fmjs` command. But now we
also offer a pure Haskell implementation, which can be installed as:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/moonad/formality
cd formality/bin/hs
cabal build
cabal install
```

This will install the `fmhs` command in your machine, which is identical to
`fmjs`, except it is pure Haskell. To test it, you can `cd` into the
`formality/src` directory and type either `fmjs Main` or `fmhs Main`. Both
commands should output:

```bash
Main: IO<Unit>

All terms check.
```

Thanks to GHC, Formality's type checker won't stack overflow when checking large
type-level computations anymore. Moreover, native Haskell HOAS is much faster
than JavaScript lambdas, making the type-checker even faster than before. Even
better, you can now import Formality from Haskell, if you ever want to check
proofs inside your Haskell applications, for whatever reason.

Compiling Formality to Haskell
------------------------------

You can compile Formality functions directly to Haskell, and use them inside
your Haskell programs. For example, the
[`Example.fm`](https://github.com/moonad/Formality/blob/master/src/Example.fm)
file has the following definition:

```c
Example.sum(n: Nat): Nat
  case n {
    zero: 0
    succ: n + Example.sum(n.pred)
  }
```

It computes the sum of all numbers from `0` to `n`. You can compile it to
Haskell as:

```bash
cd formality/src
fmjs Example.sum --hs --module Sum >> Sum.hs
```

You can then create a `Main.hs` file, import and use `Example.sum`:

```haskell
import Sum

main :: IO ()
main = print (example_sum 100000000)
```

And then just compile/run as you would expect:

```bash
ghc Main.hs -o Main -O2
time ./Main
```

And it just works! 

```bash
[2 of 2] Compiling Main             ( Main.hs, Main.o )
Linking Main ...
5000000050000000

real	0m6.538s
user	0m4.897s
sys	0m1.044s
```

Since Formality compiles all its terms to λ-encodings, the entire language can
be easily embedded inside Haskell, although it does need `unsafeCoerce`. That's
because Formality's type-checker is more expressive than Haskell, and some
Formality programs simply can't be translated to it. For example, it is
impossible to translate `foo(b: Bool): if b then Nat else String` to Haskell.
`unsafeCoerce` is unavoidable and harmless, since these programs were already
type-checked, but it would still be desirable to decrease its usage in a future,
if only to make GHC happier.

What about performance?
-----------------------

It is okay. As you can see, in the example above, the `example_sum` compiled
from Formality to Haskell has added all `Integers` from `0` to `100m` in `6s` on
my notebook. If we instead wrote it manually:

```haskell
example_sum :: Integer -> Integer
example_sum 0 = 0
example_sum n = n + example_sum (n - 1)

main :: IO ()
main = print (example_sum 100000000)
```

It would take exactly the same time with `-O2`. That's because Formality
identifies λ-encoded types and compiles them to native structures, as follows:

Formality   | Haskell
----------- | -------
`Nat`       | `Integer`
`U8`        | `Word8`
`U16`       | `Word16`
`U32`       | `Word32`
`U64`       | `Word64`
`String`    | `String`
`datatypes` | `tagged accessors`
`lambdas`   | `lambdas`

By tagged accessors, I mean that, for example, a program like:

```c
type FooBar {
  foo(a: String, b: String)
  bar(n: Nat, m: Nat)
}

ex0: FooBar
  FooBar.foo("hello", "world")

ex1: FooBar
  FooBar.bar(10, 20)
```

Will get compiled to something like:

```haskell
foo = \a b -> (0, \foo bar -> foo a b)
bar = \n m -> (1, \foo bar -> bar n m)
ex0 = foo "hello" "world"
ex1 = bar 10 20
```

This is quite fast and, since this is a direct compilation (no wrapper or
interpreters), it allows GHC to heavily optimize your Formality programs. Of
course, speed will still not be comparable to hand-written Haskell, but it will
not be an issue in most common uses. As we compile more Formality types to
native Haskell structures, the gap should get smaller. Benchmarks and
comparisons would be sweet, though, so, if anyone is wondering how to
collaborate, that is a way!

Conclusion
----------

Formality is now less JavaScript and more Haskell than ever. I wish we have
moved earlier. Trust me when I say nobody was more annoyed by JavaScript than
myself. But now that Formality is written in a strongly typed language (itself),
it is free to grow larger and more featureful, something that we avoided to do,
because no sane mind wants to maintain a 100k LOC proof language written in
JavaScript. Expect Formality to evolve faster than ever!

Now, there is no excuse left. Visit our [formal proof
tutorial](https://github.com/moonad/Formality/blob/master/THEOREMS.md) and start
proving your own theorems, now! It is written for Haskellers, presenting theorem
proving concepts in a easy to follow format with key examples and exercises.

Annoying Disclaimers
--------------------

1. While the main language is entirely implemented itself (including its parser,
   type-checker, interpreter and so on), the FormalityCore->Haskell compiler, a
   [750 LOC file](https://github.com/moonad/FormCoreJS/blob/master/FmcToHs.js),
   is still JS-only. That is why we had to use `fmjs` (and not `fmhs`) to
   compile Formality to Haskell. Implementing that in Formality should take a
   day or two, but I just didn't have time yet. Once I do, the `--hs` option
   will be added to `fmhs` too.

2. I'm still not sure on how a great module system for Formality should look
   like. Should I use IPFS, like the proposal I presented on Ethereum's
   [Devcon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69vkfHKyAGY&t=20m10s)? Should I do
   something more like Unison? I don't know yet, so, in order to avoid mistakes,
   Formality has no module system yet. That means that, in order to use it, you
   **must** be on the `formality/src` directory, which is where all the base
   libraries (like `Nat`, `String`, `IO`) are. You can use the language without
   these, but most syntax sugars rely on them. So just do it for now.

3. Since Formality's type-checker is 100% HOAS, it is extremely fast, but our
   unifier / hole-filling algorithm still needs improvements. That means that,
   if you type-check hole-free programs, Formality should beat every other proof
   language. But its type-checking performance downgrades once you have many
   holes, specially because Formality re-unifies every term of every dependency
   you have. That's why type-checking `Fm.fm` still takes a few seconds. This
   will be greatly improved soon, once we start chaching filled holes. So expect
   a huge improvement in type-checking performance in the near future.
